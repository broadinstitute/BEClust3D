# added notebooks for all except 2, 3.2, 3.2.5, 4, 6 which are meant to be extra features
# 2 is sequence conservation, 3.2 and 3.2.5 are also contingent on 2
# 3.2 is prioritizing residues that are conserved
# 3.2.5 is randomising based on 3.2
# 4 is meta aggregating over multiple screens, also an optional function
# 6 add uniprot annotations is another good extra feature
